Changed since 0.9.7:
 o Add tests.
 o Update handling of binary vs text strings; str is always sent as
   type BYTEA and unicode as type TEXT, and BYTEA strings are returned as
   str-instances, while all the character string types are returned as
   unicode-instances.
 o Implement handling of date and time types.
 o Fix cursor.rowcount attribute for non-DQL statements.

Changed in 0.9.7:
 o updated inserttable (aka copy from stdin) support to correctly
   detect and report more error conditions that can happen during the
   large inserts

Changed in 0.9.6:
 o update for compatibility with Python 2.5 (Py_ssize_t instead of int types)
 o fix bug in cu.fetchmany(m) which caused the bindings to pad the
   return list with None values when m was higher than the number of
   records available

Changed in 0.9.5:
 o minor documentation updates; calling this release mature instead of beta now.

Changed in 0.9.4:
 o Added support for bulk data loads using COPY... FROM STDIN support (db.bulkload)
 o Unknwon column types are returned as buffer objects now instead
   of (possibly incomplete) Python strings
 o Added set import compatibility for Python 2.3 (several folks sent the same patch)

Changes in 0.9.3:
 o Object instances that have a __pgquote__ method can also be used as bind paramaters
 o Object instances can define a __binary__ attribute to be passed in as binary strings
 o added fetchone_dict(), fetchall_dict() and fetchmany_dict() cursor methods
 o updated the transaction creation code to automatically create transactions only when needed

Changes in 0.9.2:
 o fetchall now correctly returns an empty list when no results are produced from a select
 o fixed bug that affected bind parameters passing when multiple params are used in a query

Changes in version 0.9.1:
 o Rename cursor.messages attribute to cursor.notices
 o Renamed db.messages attributw to db.notices
