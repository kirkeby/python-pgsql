* Fix broken bind-parameter supprt, by translating '... %s .. %s' into
  '... $1 .. $2' behind the scenes.

* The large objects interface needs some attention as well (note: this is
  not the same as using BYTEA fields in a table. Large objects are a
  PostgreSQL specific thing. BYTEA columns work just fine)

* Currently we send the bind parameters in text mode to the
  server. When we retrieve the results, the result sets are also
  retrieved in text mode and have to be converted from string
  representation to Python object types. PostgreSQL supports binary mode
  transfers both ways, but documentation on how various data types need
  to be encapsulated in binary mode is sorely lacking.

* Data types which are specific to PostgreSQL are not handled
  by these bindings, instead they are returned as buffer objects;
  the affected types are geometric types, arrays, network addresses
  and bitstrings.
